# Rice Leaf Disease Detection using CNN

## Project Overview
This Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is designed to classify rice leaf diseases into three distinct categories:
* `Leaf Smut`
* `Brown Spot`
* `Bacterial Leaf Blight`

CNNs are specialized neural networks that excel in image recognition and classification tasks. They are particularly useful for detecting diseases like Leaf Smut, Brown Spot, and Bacterial Leaf Blight in rice leaves by learning patterns from images.

CNNs consist of convolutional layers that extract features, pooling layers that reduce dimensionality, and fully connected layers for classification. The architecture leverages the 2D structure of images, allowing the model to capture important features while remaining translation-invariant. CNNs are efficient and easier to train than traditional fully connected networks, making them a powerful tool for detecting rice leaf diseases with fewer parameters and improved accuracy.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Detects different types of rice leaf diseases.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Built using **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**.
- **Automated Detection**: Identifies and classifies leaf diseases from images.
- **Fast and Accurate**: Provides quick predictions with high accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images categorized into three classes:
1. **Leaf Smut**
2. **Brown Spot**
3. **Bacterial Leaf Blight**

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for building the CNN model)
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)
- **NumPy & Pandas** (for data handling)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)

## Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Results
- Achieved **97 % accuracy** on test images.
- Model generalizes well to unseen images.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance dataset with more diverse images.
- Improve model architecture for better accuracy.
- Deploy as a web or mobile app for real-world usage.
